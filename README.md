# Cheeky Toast - Beta

This desktop app is an open-source project inspired by Property Price Checker [https://propertyprice.co.nz](https://propertyprice.co.nz) </br>
The most significant difference from the above project is that this app targets New Zealand's famous "RE" website, and that this app does not use any of RE's APIs or store any of RE's proprietary data.
## Motivation (same as PPC)

 In New Zealand, it is often hard to ascertain the value that a property will sell for, so this additional pricing data point will allow the user to form a more complete picture of the likely sale price with other supplementary information from Homes and One Roof. It will also <b>save you time</b> between narrowing the search parameters on RE to find the listing price range. Instead of having a range of $50K or $100K, this tool <b>gets the exact price that the real estate agent has put as the listing price on RE</b>.</br>
